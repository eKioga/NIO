# NIO Phone interview fun!
 (Ruby) iteration test.
Iterate inclusively 1 through a 100. Print Fiz for even number. Print Biz for odd numbers. Print FizBiz for number divisible by 100.
 See nio.rb for code.

# Factorial Bonus Fun Below!

3! = 3 * 2 * 1
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
6! = 6 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
42! = 42 x 41!

factorial(3) => 6 = 3 * 2!
factorial(4) => 24 = 4 * 3!
factorial(5) => 120 = 5 * 4!
factorial(6) => 720 = 6 * 5!
factorial(42) => 42 x 41!
